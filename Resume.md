##The key theories and methods of 3D video visual quality enhancement
(2015.03 –  present )      Software Engineer

Content: Explore the key theories and corresponding theoretical mode of 3D video enhancement. 1. The theories and methods of enhancing the visual quality of 3D video; 2. Quality transmission model of 3D video; 3. The optimizing structural coding model of 3D video.

Responsibility: I am in charge of the field of 3D video quality enhancement. I proposed a distortion metric model to compress the depth map, which represent the geometry information of scene. The proposal metric utilize smaller storage to achieve better viewing experience. Compared with the state-of-art method, the proposed metric saves 20% of storage and reduce the computation complexity in addition. The related paper can be indexed in DCC 2016, which is the top conference of data compression. （C++）
##The computational model of binocular visual characteristic and 3D video processing and quality index
(2014.06 - 2015.02)    Software Engineer

Content: Build the model for binocular visual characteristic, and propose methods to promote visual experience quality of 3D video. 1. Build the binocular quality index platform; 2. Build the sharpness and comfort measure and process model based on monocular and binocular visual characteristic;   

Responsibility: I am in charge of the field of improving the visual experience quality. I implement a platform to stabilize the shaky 3D video based on the human visual system. My work focus on tracing the object, smoothing the trajectory, finding the correspondences in multi-views and depth based image rendering. （C++、Python）

##Classifying the Mandarin and the English sound                            (2015.04 - 2015.05)    Software Engineer

Responsibility: By the literature research, I choose the openSMILE to extract the sound features. Also I explore the characteristic of both languages. And the classifier is trained by Adaboost algorithm, and I won the first in the whole institute. (Matlab)

##The Real time Rendering based on GPU                                        (2014.03 - 2014.06)     Software Engineer

Content: Change the original serial rendering algorithm into parallel algorithm, and implement it in GPU. And make it meet the function of real time rendering.  

Responsibility: I am in charge of the whole design of the parallel algorithm. And the function of real time rendering is implemented in GPU. Compared with the original scheme, it faster 20 times.（C++）
